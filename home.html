                Summary: Luis Velarde explores what makes using social media addictive and how it may affect a users' wellbeing. Velarde argues that social media use human connections as a drug by honing its addictive nature. They explain how social media influences the release of dopamine, leading to addictive behavior. Further contributors to the addictive nature of social media include its easy accessibility, practically infante content, and the novelty of that content. Velarde refers to social media as a contributing factor to the growing youth mental health crisis, citing the U.S. Surgeon General’s advisory on social media and youth mental health.
